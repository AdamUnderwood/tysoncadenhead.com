Maybe its the software engineer in me, but I'm always trying to find ways to hack my life to remove unneeded repetitive tasks when there is an easier way to get to the goal in mind. It drives me crazy that the floor in our house has to be swept every night after the kids leave an explosion of cheese and dirt from outside all over the floor. Any task that takes a considerable amount of time and is done in basically the same way seems like an easy candidate for automation. I'm still working on the sweeping problem, but I have a solution for another problem that my wife was dealing with. You see, my wife keeps all of her recipes for meals on Pinterest, so when she plans on making some of the recipes, she has to go in recipe by recipe and add together all of the ingredients so that she can have a shopping list to reflect her meal plan. For a week of groceries, the process could easily take upwards of an hour. I knew there had to be a better way, so when I couldn't find it online, I set out to make it myself. My answer to this problem is *[Pingredient](http://pingredient.com).*

Pingredient lets you search your Pinterest boards for the food you want to eat and then you can just click a button to add it to your shopping list. It can easily take an hour long meal planning experience and convert it to 5 or 10 minutes.

If this sounds like something you might want to use, it is currently totally free to use as a web app at [pingredient.com](http://pingredient.com). I'm planning to make some improvements based on feedback and hopefully launch native apps for iOS and Android this Spring.

It isn't rocket science, but if you need some help getting started, here is a quick little video showing how to use Pingredient:

Please sign up for the email list near the bottom of the page when you start using Pingredient. I promise not to spam you, but it would be helpful for letting you know when new features are available or when the native apps are released.

I'm excited to know what you think. I'll be writing some posts in the near future about the technology behind it, but until then, please let me know if there is anything I can do to make it better. Now, go turn your pins in a shopping list.
