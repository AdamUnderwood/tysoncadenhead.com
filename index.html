<p>Sails JS is a really cool framework for building realtime web applications. Today I am going to show you how easy it is to create a new Sails project. In many ways, Sails is similar to Ruby On Rails. It allows you to create a new application and sets enough defaults that you can run it right away.</p>

            <p>Setting up multiple types of authentication on an application can be a daunting task. There are a ton of moving pieces and you want to make sure that your user model is up to the task of consuming any type of authentication you throw at it. To that end, I recently set up Facebook authentication on a Sails.js app I&#39;m working on and I thought it might be worth sharing how easy it actually turned out to be.</p>

            <p>In my opinion, <a href="http://sailsjs.org/">Sails</a> is one of the best Node MVC frameworks out there. It provides a really clean architecture and is completely customizable. The Socket.io integration also gives it an edge over many of the competitors.</p>
<p>I only recently started playing around with Sails, and I wanted to add a unit testing suite to the application I was working on. I searched for other people who were doing test driven development in Sails, but I wasn&#39;t satisfied with the results. As it turns out, getting tests in place for Sails was one of the easier things I&#39;ve done in my life and I was able to get a few unit tests running withing 30 minutes of sitting down to do it.</p>

            <p>About a month ago, I switched from running my blog using Poet.js on Nodejitsu to using Harp.js to compile it as a static site. There are several benefits to taking this approach. First of all, I can host the site using any server environment. When I build it, all that I have are HTML, CSS and JavaScript files and they can be hosted with Node, Apache, IIS or any other server. Another benefit is that there are several places where I can host my blog for free.</p>
<p>I ended up choosing to go with Github pages because this is a web development blog and I thought it was well-suited for their platform. This is how I got it working.</p>

            <p>One of the best parts of CSS3 is the ability to do keyframe animation. Once upon a time, if you wanted to animate DOM elements in the browser, you had to do it with JavaScript. CSS3 animations are generally smoother and perform better than moving elements around with JavaScript. They also do really well on mobile devices.</p>
<p>With a little bit of working knowledge, it&#39;s really not hard to make some nice looking CSS3 animations, and that is what we are going to do today. If you have ever studied animation, you probably know that one of the first things you need to learn is how to do squash, stretch and bounce, which are the cornerstones of exaggerated animation physics. Today, I&#39;m going to walk you through how you can handle those basics just using CSS3.</p>

            <p>If you have worked on a large scalable web application, I probably don&#39;t have to tell you how important it is to keep your modules from directly referencing each other. There are several Pub/Sub libraries that have emerged to solve that problem. Some of the main contenders are <a href="https://github.com/mroderick/PubSubJS">PubSubJS</a>, <a href="https://github.com/postaljs/postal.js">Postal</a> and <a href="http://amplifyjs.com/">Amplify</a>.</p>
<p>With several options to chose from, there is certainly value in abstracting away whichever choice you make so that you could easily switch the Pub/Sub library out without impacting the application. There are various reasons for switching libraries. Your library of choice might become unmaintained, or perhaps it will evolve in a way that doesn&#39;t suite your needs, or perhaps a better solution will emerge. Whatever the case, you certainly don&#39;t want to be locked in and have to change every file of your application if you do make the choice to switch at some point. Additionally, if you are using an AMD loader, you get the added benefit of not needing to require the pub/sub library in every module that uses it. This is how I have gone about abstracting my pub/sub libraries in applications in the past.</p>

            <p>I have been a huge animation enthusiast since high-school. I even went to college hoping to become a professional computer animator before I got sucked into the wild world of computer programming. I have recently been dabbling with <a href="http://threejs.org/">Three JS</a>, which is a JavaScript engine for creating 3D models and animations for the browser.</p>
<p>Of course, my interests go beyond just making games and website animations. I like that the engine is written in JavaScript and that it uses web technologies like the canvas and WebGL to render the models. To that end, I have been exploring ways to export animations I make with Three JS to an external video file that I could use to stitch together actual films just like any application-based 3D animation software like Maya, Blender or Lightwave. I know it&#39;s crazy, but I think this might actually work.</p>

            <p>There has been a lot of buzz around whether or not jQuery is needed for building web applications anymore. Many blog posts have sprung up about how to do common things that are typically done with jQuery just using vanilla JavaScript. While it is important to know where jQuery is needed and where a leaner solution could provide a quicker load time and less complexity, for most large-scale projects, the last thing you want to be worrying about is optimizing against various browser types and nuances.</p>
<p>Reactive frameworks such as Knockout may seem on the surface to work pretty well without needing jQuery at all, but as you get deeper into complex interfaces, you might find yourself needing something such as a jQuery UI component. So where should jQuery and DOM interaction go in a well-structured Knockout application?</p>

            <p>For the past year and a half, I have been working for a completely remote company called <a href="http://appendto.com">appendTo</a>. We literally have employees working from their houses, coffee shops and Buffalo Wildwings across the globe. One of the main draws to the company for me was the ability to work from anywhere.</p>
<p>There are obviously numerous benefits to remote working for the employee, but I&#39;ve also come to the conclusion that if I were ever to start a company of my own, I would absolutely build it as a 100% remote company because there are a lot of benefits for the employer as well. Here are a few reasons why.</p>

            <p>Meteor is a really nice framework for building real-time applications. The example application shows off how easy it is to share code between the server and client by putting the code inside a single JavaScript file at the root of the project. Running the example app from a single file definitely shows off how awesome sharing code is, but it also made me scratch my head trying to figure out how to organize a larger application. After reading through the documentation and a lot of trail and error, here is the organization that I have landed on.</p>

Typically, you only want to test the behavior of a single module, but if you are using an AMD loader like RequireJS, you may be pulling in several other libraries and modules just to test a single module. The point of the unit test is to test an individual unit, not to test how it works with other dependencies.</p>
<p>If only there was a way to trick the test runner into thinking that the other modules were loaded by providing simplified stubs of the methods they actually performed! Good news, that is totally possible using <a href="https://github.com/iammerrick/Squire.js/">Squire</a>. Don&#39;t run away when you see the creepy looking mascot on the GitHub page, Squire is totally worth your time.</p>

            <p>I remember when I first started playing with JavaScript in high-school. The first thing I loved about it was that I could change things without the browser even refreshing. It was like I was a magician moving elements around, hiding and showing things, totally in control of what the user could see. All I had to do was directly modify elements in the DOM and they would instantly react. But that was in the late 90s and early 2000s, now I have found reasons for abstracting away DOM interaction. That&#39;s not to say that DOM manipulation shouldn&#39;t happen, it just shouldn&#39;t be the glue that holds your application together.</p>

            <p>Over the past year, I have been doing a ton of work on Knockout applications. There is a lot to love about Knockout. The declarative bindings allow you to keep your UI data-driven and synced at all times, which is a huge win when you are working on large scalable applications. However, one place where the Knockout core is lacking is that it is not prescriptive about how code should be written for it. That was the beginning of the idea behind ko.ninja. If we could put some structure around our viewModels, we could do some really cool things.</p>

            <p>Authentication can be something of a road-blocker in application development. I can&#39;t tell you how many times I&#39;ve had a great idea for an app, but instead of jumping in and writing the core functionality, I try to tackle the authentication layer first. The problem is that once I&#39;ve gotten authentication in place, my excitement for the project has faded because I wasn&#39;t working on the project itself, just trying to set up a login system. Meteor takes the work out of setting up authentication so that you can focus on more important things, like writing the core functionality for your app.</p>

            <p>In the old days, if you wanted to get up-to-date data from the sever, you would need to set an interval on the client-side and continuously make Ajax calls to see if new data was available. The problem is that the data was never exactly real time. It was just what had been fetched every fifteen seconds or so. If you pinged the server too often, you would create needless overhead and there may or may not even be new data for the client to consume. The problems with this sort of approach are obvious.</p>

            <p>Test driven development (or TDD for short) is the practice of writing your unit tests prior to writing the code for your application. Already having your tests in place informs your software design decisions and serves as a way to determine whether your code is accomplishing what it is supposed to. The benefits of TDD are obvious, so why is it so hard to approach writing software this way?</p>

            <p>One way to reduce the loading time of your website or application is to merge multiple images together into one large sprite. The benefit is that only one http request has to be made instead of multiple requests. Of course, managing a sprite image and the CSS that uses it can be a pain in the neck. That is where <a href="http://compass-style.org/">Compass</a> comes in. Compass has a really cool helper that lets you import an entire folder of images and that it will automatically sprite for you.</p>

            <p>If you haven&#39;t used Sencha Architect to build your Sencha applications, you are totally missing out. Sencha Architect is essentially a WYSIWYG editor that allows you to construct applications by dragging and dropping components into the stage area. <code>Sencha Architect App Development</code> from Packt publishing is a really helpful book that shows you how to construct an application in Sencha Architect from start to finish.</p>

            <p>If you&#39;ve been creating applications using Node, you&#39;ve probably fallen in love with the built-in package management framework &quot;NPM&quot;. Using NPM makes life a ton easier because instead of needing to go out and download all of the third-party packages your project will need, you can just type a line or two in the terminal and everything is good to go. What if there was a tool like NPM for managing client-side JavaScript libraries? There is one. It is called Bower.&quot;</p>

            <p>Sometimes when you are developing applications, it can be handy to know how long it takes for an operation to complete. For example, you might want to know how long an element takes to render or how long it takes for an Ajax call to resolve. Luckily, most of the modern web browsers have a <code>console.time</code> function that makes that easier.</p>

            <p>When I first started writing Node applications, my main question was how I could keep the server running on a live server.</p>
<p>The answer I finally discovered was <a href="https://github.com/nodejitsu/forever">Forever</a>. Forever is a CLI tool that keeps a node process running indefinitely. That means that you can ssh into the place where your code is hosted, start the server with Forever and then close your ssh connection and the server will still be running. It is a thing of beauty.</p>

Sencha Touch opts for the simple key-value storage because it is supported in basically every relevant browser today.</p>

            <p>The release of Node.js in 2009 ushered in discussions about the endless possibilities for sharing code between the client-side and the server side. While there are several good examples of entire libraries working very well on both ends, most of the projects that are written in Node tend to shy away from sharing the meat of the application with the browser. I think that the real issue is developers being stuck in our ways. We are trying to write traditional web apps in a language that can actually go beyond what traditional scripting languages were even capable of.</p>

            <p>JavaScript is different from other programming languages because it is asynchronous. That means that there is a possibility that several things can be happening at the same time. In other words, JavaScript doesn&#39;t wait for one thing to execute before going to the next. If you are waiting for a timeout to fire, or a response from an Ajax call or a database transaction, while the process completes, JavaScript silently moves on.</p>

            <p>I&#39;ve been working on several projects in the past year or so that have required me to write some jQuery plugins and custom JavaScript widgets and I feel like several of them could definitely be useful for other developers.  I&#39;ve set a goal this year to release at least two projects to the community, but it&#39;s tough to know which ones people will find most useful. Since it takes a little work to get a library to a place where it works under multiple scenarios and that&#39;s even before the lengthy process of writing documentation, I thought I&#39;d put it up to a vote to see what people would like to see and use.  Whatever seems to have the most positive attention is what I&#39;ll probably end up open-sourcing first.</p>

            <p>Most of us can agree that spawning popups with JavaScript is usually a user experience FAIL.  We&#39;ve all been to websites that opened several popup ads. That is always something to avoid.  Malicious and ad-happy sites have made it necessary for browser plugins and some browsers to block JavaScript popups altogether.</p>

            <p>Several months ago I wrote about <a href="http://tysonlloydcadenhead.com/blog/sencha-application-event-listening/">event binding</a> using ExtJS or Sencha touch.  Something that you may or may not know is that you can achieve the same thing with jQuery using custom even binding.</p>

Collecting stuff is one thing, but these people have no organizational system for the items that they collect.  They literally have piles of so much useless junk that their houses become essentially unlivable.  Many of them don&#39;t even have a single walkway to navigate through their homes.  They could lead better lives, but they are unwilling to let go of their material possessions.</p>

If I am going to make a mobile version of a website, I am going to use jQuery Mobile.  If I am going to make a &quot;native&quot; mobile application, I will be more likely use Sencha Touch.</p>

            <p>JavaScript is a loosely-typed case sensitive language.  Technically everything in the language is a variable.  Yes, it may be a string, a function, an array or an object, but everything is a variable at its core.  Because you can make your variables all lowercase or all uppercase or anywhere in between, it’s important for the sake of code readability to have a pattern for how the variables will be cased.</p>

The solution?  Apparently, the DOM was still rendering when the Ext.onReady block was firing because the iPhone 4 was not properly using the Ext.onReady block.  </p>

            <p>If you&#39;re like me, you are constantly looking for better ways to architect your JavaScript applications to be scalable and modular.  One of the keys to writing an application that fits the bill is to use reusable components that, instead of calling other functions or components directly, broadcast events that multiple components may be listening for.  I&#39;ve been on a hunt to figure out how to do this correctly for a while now and I&#39;ve finally come upon a few good solutions.</p>

            <p>Ajax is awesome for things like rich internet applications that don&#39;t require SEO because of their internal nature, or for on-page events like form validation and submitting, but from an SEO standpoint, adding content to the DOM is illegible. But you still want the increased usability of not having to reload the page every time an element or two is changed, right?  The fact is that users don&#39;t like waiting on your page to load, and the more you can do to keep from reloading the whole thing, the better.  But still, there&#39;s the problem of JavaScript DOM manipulation not jiving with Search Engine Optimization.  What&#39;s a person to do?</p>

            <p>Nearly a year ago I was working for a company in the financial services industry that had need for a scalable, secure, AJAX application.  It was extremely large in scale and scope and it quickly became clear that I was going to have to have some sort of organizational structure to build the application upon.  My server-side experience at this point was primarily in writing C#, and I had fallen in love with the organization of the .NET MVC design pattern.  From there, I had been doing some contract work using CakePHP, which is also an MVC framework.  While I had written JavaScript for my websites, an entire application is completely different.  I looked around at frameworks and eventually settled on <a href="http://javascriptmvc.com">JavaScript MVC</a> for its basis in the MVC framework as well as its rich feature set.  So what does JavascriptMVC come with &quot;out of the box?&quot;</p>

            <p>As the web has grown, the Javascript programming language has grown with it to become rich and robust.  Whereas websites used to have only a couple of lines of Javascript code used in them, Javascript has evolved to a point where it often does a large part of the heavy lifting in Internet Application development.  With the evolution of Javascript, the code typically used on a site can often grow to a point where it is bulky hard to maintain if it is not properly constructed.  That&#39;s why the topic for today is on how to architect Javascript in such a way to make it easy to maintain. Javascript is a programming language, after all, so we should treat it with the same care and respect we would treat server-side code.</p>

My goal through this blog is to tackle some of the relevant issues pertaining to web usability, and user experience as well as sharing some client-side and possibly a little bit of server-side code that can help other people who are trying to create user friendly websites.  Since that is my ultimate purpose here, I feel like I need to lay some groundwork by explaining what User Experience Design and what User Interface Development actually entail.  This is just laying down the tracks for some more in-depth discussion down the road, but we&#39;ve got to start somewhere, right?  Let&#39;s jump into it.</p>

            <p>SEO has been a hot topic especially in the last few years as the number of websites on the Internet has increased and being easily found on most search engines has been increasingly difficult. Everyone who has a website is looking for ways to make their site more accessible to Google and other modern search tools, so what are the basics? How can you take your website and bump it up in search engine rankings? Here are some clues.</p>

            <p>A couple of years ago, if you had asked me what my take on design patterns for internet applications was, I would have probably given you a blank, questioning stare.  You see, as sad as it is, proper design and architectural patterns aren&#39;t exactly the norm in the web development world.  Today, I&#39;m going to give you a quick overview on what architectural design patterns are and why they&#39;re important and then focus in on MVC.</p>

            <p>Microsoft released Internet Explorer 6 nearly eight years ago in August of 2001. Since then, they have released two new versions of their web browser, IE7 and IE8 and have officially stopped supporting the outdated cousin, IE6. So why is it that most web developers are still supporting a browser that even Microsoft itself has turned its back on?</p>
